# Scratch-Clustering

Hello,

Need scikit-learn library to run. Link for install: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

cluster.py is run with Python3 and needs to have a correct path to the input file. I had mine saved on the desktop, so file path will be different for you.

Problems:
- After parsing the project_block_stacks_mini file, I was unsuccessful when trying to delete the words "coming soon" in 2 instances. These words are preceded and followed by multiple backslashes which did not go through the parser.
